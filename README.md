# 🧠 Go Learning Journey by Mujammal Ahmed

Welcome to my Go learning journal!  
I'm learning the Go programming language from scratch and documenting everything I learn — day by day — in this repository.

My goal is to build real-world projects with Go and help others learn from my journey.

## 📅 Progress Overview

| Day | Topics Covered |
|-----|----------------|
| 1   | Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions (`init`, IIFE), Scope (package, local, block) |

## 📚 Daily Logs

### 🗓️ Day 1

**Topics:**
- Variables (`var`, `:=`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`)
- Functions: standard, `init()`, and IIFE-style anonymous functions
- Scope: package-level, local, and block scope

**Code Sample:**
> See `day1/main.go` for the full code.

**Key Learnings:**
- Go requires explicit declarations — very clean but strict.
- `init()` runs before `main()` automatically.
- You can simulate IIFE using anonymous functions.

**Resources:**
- [Init Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuWkHIyvwi0)
- [Fundamentals of Functions](https://medium.com/@danielabatibabatunde1/fundamentals-of-functions-in-golang-df4dd0c3072f)

## 🚀 Goal

To learn Go from the ground up and build a complete project by the end of this journey.  
All topics and mini-projects will be documented here to help others get started with Go.
