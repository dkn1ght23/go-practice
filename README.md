# ðŸ§  Go Learning Journey by Mujammal Ahmed

Welcome to my Go learning journal!  
I'm learning the Go programming language from scratch and documenting everything I learn â€” day by day â€” in this repository.  
My goal is to build real-world projects with Go and help others learn from my journey.

## ðŸ“… Progress Overview

| Day | Topics Covered |
|-----|----------------|
| [1](#day-1) | Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions (init, IIFE), Scope (package, local, block) |

## ðŸ“š Daily Logs

<details>
  <summary><strong>Day 1 â€” Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions (init, IIFE), Scope</strong></summary>

  <br/>

  **Topics:**
  - Variables (var, :=)
  - Conditional Statements (if, else)
  - Functions: standard, init(), and IIFE-style anonymous functions
  - Scope: package-level, local, and block scope

  **Code Sample:**  
  > See day1/main.go for the full code.

  **Key Learnings:**
  - Go requires explicit declarations â€” very clean but strict.
  - `init()` runs automatically before `main()`.
  - You can simulate Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) using anonymous functions.

  **Resources:**
  - [Init Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuWkHIyvwi0)
  - [Fundamentals of Functions](https://medium.com/@danielabatibabatunde1/fundamentals-of-functions-in-golang-df4dd0c3072f)

## ðŸš€ Goal

To learn Go from the ground up and build a complete project by the end of this journey.  
All topics and mini-projects will be documented here to help others get started with Go.
