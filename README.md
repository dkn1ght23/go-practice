# üß† Go Learning Journey by Mujammal Ahmed

Welcome to my Go learning journal!  
I'm learning the Go programming language from scratch and documenting everything I learn ‚Äî day by day ‚Äî in this repository.  
My goal is to build real-world projects with Go and help others learn from my journey.

## üìö Daily Logs

<details id="day-1">
<summary><strong>Day 1 ‚Äî Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions (`init`, IIFE), Scope</strong></summary>

**Topics:**
- Variables (`var`, `:=`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`)
- Functions: standard, `init()`, and IIFE-style anonymous functions
- Scope: package-level, local, and block scope

**Code Sample:**  
See `day1/main.go` for the full code.

**Key Learnings:**
- Go requires explicit declarations ‚Äî very clean but strict.
- `init()` runs automatically before `main()`.
- You can simulate Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) using anonymous functions.

**Resources:**
- [Init Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuWkHIyvwi0)
- [Fundamentals of Functions](https://medium.com/@danielabatibabatunde1/fundamentals-of-functions-in-golang-df4dd0c3072f)

<summary><strong>Day 2 ‚Äî Parameters vs Arguments, First-order & Higher-order Functions, Closures, Function Types</strong></summary>

1. **Parameters vs Arguments**  
   In Go, parameters are the named variables defined in a function‚Äôs declaration, while arguments are the actual values you pass when calling the function.  
   Go uses **pass-by-value** by default ‚Äî meaning the function gets a copy of the argument, not the original.  
   However, when you pass **pointers** or **reference types** (slices, maps, channels, functions), the function can modify the original data because both point to the same underlying memory.  

   **Key takeaway:** parameters are the ‚Äúplaceholders,‚Äù arguments are the ‚Äúreal data.‚Äù Whether the function can change the caller‚Äôs data depends on whether you pass by value or by reference.

---

2. **First-order Functions**  
   A first-order function:
   - Takes only data types (e.g., `int`, `string`, `struct`) as inputs.
   - Returns only data types ‚Äî **not** functions.  

   These are perfect for straightforward tasks like calculations, string processing, or struct initialization.  

   **Key takeaway:** if a function never accepts or returns another function, it‚Äôs first-order.

---

3. **Higher-order Functions**  
   A higher-order function is one that:
   - Takes one or more functions as parameters, **or**
   - Returns a function, **or**
   - Does both.

   Go supports higher-order functions because functions are **first-class citizens** ‚Äî they can be stored in variables, passed to other functions, or returned.  

   Common patterns:
   - **Closures** ‚Äî returned functions that ‚Äúremember‚Äù variables from their outer scope.
   - **Middleware** ‚Äî wrapping handlers with extra logic (logging, authentication).
   - **Factories** ‚Äî generating functions with pre-set behavior.

   **Key takeaway:** higher-order functions power flexibility, reusability, and composition.

---

4. **Closures**  
   A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body.  
   Those variables are **captured** and remembered even after the outer function has returned.  

   **Key takeaway:** closures combine behavior and remembered state ‚Äî useful for counters, ID generators, and configuration-based function builders.

---

5. **Function Types & nil Functions**  
   In Go, functions have **explicit types** based on parameter and return signatures (e.g., `func(int) int`).  
   Function variables **default to nil** ‚Äî so always check before calling if they might not be set.

<summary><strong>Day 3 ‚Äî Internal Memory</strong></summary>

Go‚Äôs memory management model is a blend of simplicity and power: it provides automatic memory allocation, garbage collection, and efficient stack and heap management.  
To write performant Go programs, you need to understand how Go manages memory internally:  
- When and why variables live on the **stack** or the **heap**  
- How Go decides which memory region to use via **escape analysis**  
- The effects of **pointers, closures, slices, and garbage collection** on memory layout  
- How to profile and optimize memory usage using Go‚Äôs tooling

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stack vs Heap ‚Äî `day3/stack_vs_heap`

Go organizes memory into two main regions:  
- **Stack:** a contiguous, fast memory area used for function calls, local variables, and parameters. Each goroutine gets its own stack, which grows and shrinks dynamically. Stack allocation is cheap because it‚Äôs just pointer arithmetic, and memory is automatically freed when a function returns.  
- **Heap:** a shared memory area for data that outlives the function call or whose lifetime cannot be determined at compile time. Heap objects are managed by Go‚Äôs garbage collector.

**Why does this matter?**  
Variables that live on the stack can be accessed quickly, but those escaping to the heap incur overhead from GC and slower allocation. Understanding when Go puts data on the heap or stack can help optimize your program‚Äôs performance.

**Example:**  
The `01_stack_vs_heap` example shows functions that return pointers to local variables (which forces heap allocation) versus functions that return values directly (allowing stack allocation). Running this example with compiler escape analysis enabled (`go build -gcflags='-m'`) reveals which variables escape.
